# Design patterns

## What are design patterns?

In the history of programming developers most of the time encounter very similar or same programming problems (that's why StackOverflow is useful) and to the most of problems there were created solutions.

In OOP those solutions are called *design patterns* and were adopted to the most object oriented languages.
